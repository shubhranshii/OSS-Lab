The `Calculator` class performs basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- Constructor (`__init__`): Initializes an instance of the `Calculator` class.

 Methods:

 `add(self, a, b)`
- Purpose: Adds two numbers `a` and `b`.
- Arguments: `a` (first number), `b` (second number).
- Returns: Sum of `a` and `b` as a float.

 `subtract(self, a, b)`
- Purpose: Subtracts `b` from `a`.
- Arguments: `a` (initial number), `b` (number to subtract).
- Returns: Difference of `a` and `b` as a float.

 `multiply(self, a, b)`
- Purpose: Multiplies `a` and `b`.
- Arguments: `a` (first number), `b` (second number).
- Returns: Product of `a` and `b` as a float.

 `divide(self, a, b)`
- Purpose: Divides `a` by `b`.
- Arguments: `a` (dividend), `b` (divisor).
- Raises: `ZeroDivisionError` if `b` is zero.
- Returns: Quotient of `a` divided by `b` as a float.

 Exception Class

- CalculatorError: Custom exception class for potential use, currently not implemented in the methods provided.
