## Code Structure

1. **Global Variables and Structures:**
   - `adjacencyMatrix`: A 26x26 matrix that stores the distances between each pair of cities (represented by uppercase letters A-Z). A value of `-1` indicates no direct path between cities.
   - `isExists`: An array to check whether a city is present in the graph.
   - `dist`: An array to store the shortest distances from the source to each city.
   - `parentArr`: An array to store the parent node for each city in the shortest path tree.
   - `Node`: A structure to represent a node in the min-heap, containing the city and its distance from the source.
   - `MinHeap`: A structure to represent the min-heap with an array of nodes, a capacity, and the current size of the heap.

2. **Min-Heap Functions:**
   - `initializeMinHeap`: Initializes the min-heap with a given capacity and allocates memory for the internal array.
   - `swapMinHeapNodes`: Swaps two nodes in the min-heap.
   - `parentOfHeapNode`, `leftChildOfHeapNode`, `rightChildOfHeapNode`: Helper functions to get the parent, left, and right child indices of a node in the heap.
   - `getMinElementFromMinHeap`: Returns the minimum element (root) from the heap.
   - `insertElementToMinHeap`: Inserts a new node into the min-heap and ensures the heap property is maintained.
   - `heapify`: Maintains the min-heap property by rearranging nodes when a node is removed.
   - `extractMinElementFromMinHeap`: Removes the minimum element from the heap and restructures the heap.

3. **Graph and Input Functions:**
   - `readInputFile`: Reads the adjacency matrix from a file provided by the user. The file contains edges between cities and their distances.
   - `showAdjacencyMatrix`: Displays the adjacency matrix for the graph.

4. **Shortest Path Calculation:**
   - `printPath`: Recursively prints the path from the source to a given destination using the `parentArr`.
   - `shortestPath`: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find and print the shortest path between two cities entered by the user.

5. **Main Function:**
   - Presents a menu to the user with options to read a file, display the adjacency matrix, find the shortest path, or exit the program.

## Function Documentation

### Min-Heap Functions

- **`initializeMinHeap`**
  ```c
  void initializeMinHeap(struct MinHeap *minHeap, int capacity)
  ```
  Initializes the min-heap with the specified capacity, allocating memory for the heap's internal array.

- **`swapMinHeapNodes`**
  ```c
  void swapMinHeapNodes(struct Node *x, struct Node *y)
  ```
  Swaps two nodes in the heap to maintain heap properties.

- **`parentOfHeapNode`, `leftChildOfHeapNode`, `rightChildOfHeapNode`**
  ```c
  int parentOfHeapNode(int i);
  int leftChildOfHeapNode(int i);
  int rightChildOfHeapNode(int i);
  ```
  Helper functions to calculate the indices of the parent, left child, and right child for a given node index in the heap.

- **`getMinElementFromMinHeap`**
  ```c
  struct Node getMinElementFromMinHeap(struct MinHeap *minHeap)
  ```
  Returns the minimum element (the root) of the heap without removing it.

- **`insertElementToMinHeap`**
  ```c
  void insertElementToMinHeap(struct MinHeap *minHeap, struct Node element)
  ```
  Inserts a new node into the min-heap and ensures the heap property is maintained by bubbling up the new element.

- **`heapify`**
  ```c
  void heapify(struct MinHeap *minHeap, int i)
  ```
  Maintains the heap property by rearranging nodes in a subtree rooted at index `i`, ensuring the smallest element is at the root.

- **`extractMinElementFromMinHeap`**
  ```c
  void extractMinElementFromMinHeap(struct MinHeap *minHeap)
  ```
  Removes the minimum element from the heap, replaces it with the last element, and calls `heapify` to maintain heap properties.

### Graph and Input Functions

- **`readInputFile`**
  ```c
  void readInputFile()
  ```
  Reads a file specified by the user to populate the adjacency matrix. Each line in the file specifies an edge between two cities and the distance between them.

- **`showAdjacencyMatrix`**
  ```c
  void showAdjacencyMatrix()
  ```
  Displays the adjacency matrix of the graph, showing distances between connected cities.

### Shortest Path Calculation

- **`printPath`**
  ```c
  void printPath(int j)
  ```
  Recursively prints the path from the source to the city represented by index `j` using the `parentArr` to backtrack.

- **`shortestPath`**
  ```c
  void shortestPath()
  ```
  Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source city to a destination city specified by the user. It updates the distance array and parent array to track the shortest path and prints the path and its length.

### Main Function

- **`main`**
  ```c
  int main()
  ```
  Provides a menu-driven interface for the user to read a file, show the adjacency matrix, find the shortest path, or exit the program. It continuously prompts for input until the user chooses to exit.
